We are interested in Artificial Intelligence, Optimization, and Machine Learning. Located at the intersection of mathematics and computer science, our aim is to develop new methodologies (e.g., new optimization and learning algorithms), work on combining learning and decision-making, as well as design AI Systems for real-world deployment in various application contexts.
